 After researching for the best portfolio sites building practices, I decided to utilize the powers of Jekyll for my site. 
  Written in Ruby, Jekyll is a light weight and fast site generator and offers some great advantages compared to the other alternatives. 
I wanted to build and deploy fast and I was able to navigate my way through jekyll after reading  its documentation.  You can get started [here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/01-setup/).(Some Ruby knowledge is required).
 My second criteria for picking a framework was the ability to add and remove posts for my Blog project. Jekyll is blog aware and renders Markdown files which comes in handy if you are planning to continuosly add content to your page. 
Finally I wanted to have fun building my site. Although Jekyll offers a ton of themes I wanted to build my own and enjoy the process of learning a new skill.  

  [Jekyll's philosophy:](https://jekyllrb.com/philosophy/):  "Jekyll does what you tell it to do â€” no more, no less. It doesn't try to outsmart users by making bold assumptions, nor does it burden them with needless complexity and configuration. Put simply, Jekyll gets out of your way and allows you to concentrate on what truly matters: your content."
